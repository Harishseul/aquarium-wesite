        <center><h3>EXOTIC FISHES</h3></center>
       <h3>Discus Fish:</h3><br> 
       <button type="Button" onclick="location.href='https://youtu.be/6AjIiFMnmNQ?si=N3duA5HWYLGRVb8v'"">watch</button>
       <img src="img discus.jpg " width="400" height="200"> <p font="30px"> These are colorful, flat-bodied fish that are native to the Amazon River basin. They require a lot of care and attention, but their vib
        rant colors make them a popular choice for aquariums.The Discus fish is by many considered the king of freshwater fish and the ultimate challenge in the freshwater hobby. It is a gorgeous cichlid fish with a unique body shape and an incredible amount of different color patterns,
        due to years and years of breeding. They used to be very challenging to keep because most were wild caught species, but the common aquarium bred species of today adapt easily to the aquarium life.
         </p>
         <p><strong>WATER MAINTENENCE:</strong> Water maintenance
            Regular water changes are important as these big fish’s metabolism works faster in warm water and they produce more waste than, let’s say, the average household freshwater community aquarium fish. Equally important is to keep the tank oxygenated at all times – because warmer water means less oxygen – preferably with a streaming pump, to keep the surface area moving.</p>
        <h3>Guppies:</h3>
        <button type="Button" onclick="location.href='https://youtu.be/t5elaFG28-E?si=p58PUqqhztL1w9dR">watch</button>
        <img src="3460053.jpg" width="400" height="200"> <p font="30px">The Guppy is a small species of fish in the Poeciliidae family. People keep quite a few members of this family as aquarium fish, including the molly, swordtail, platy, and more.
            These fish prefer freshwater habitats. However, they can also survive in brackish ecosystems as well. Because of their small size, they generally avoid fast-moving water or excessively deep areas. Some common preferred habitats include streams, ponds, small pools of water, and more.
            In home aquariums, these fish thrive in tanks with 5 – 10 gallons of water or more. You should keep their water temperature between 75° and 85° F. They also need a filtration system to keep the water clean, and a pH level around 7.
        </p>
        <p><strong>WATER MAINTENENCE:</strong>Guppies are small fish and are some what hardy. Changing a few gallons by weekly should be adequate. Instead of changing the water completely every once in a while, it's best to change part of the water (normally 15–30% is recommended, depending on the size of the tank) once per week.</p>
        <h3>Betta Fish:</h3>
        <button type="Button" onclick="location.href='https://youtu.be/eEoYqsG6ECg?si=O9Jk7BmCCAWjDoEH'">watch</button>
        <img src="1078636.jpg" width="400" height="300"><p font="30px">A labyrinth fish has the unique ability to breathe oxygen directly from the air and also take in oxygen from its gills. As a result, bettas and other labyrinth fish can survive for short periods of time out of water and if needed, can inhale the air around them (provided they stay moist.)
            Also known as Siamese fighting fish, these colorful fish are known for their long, flowing fins. They are relatively easy to care for and can be kept in small tanks .
             </p>
             <p><strong>WATER MAINTENENCE:</strong>In filtered aquariums, change 10% of the water every week or 25% every 2 weeks and change the filter cartridge at least once per month. Never change all of your betta's water at one time! Always treat tap water with Aqueon BettaBowl Plus or Water Conditioner before adding it to the aquarium.</p>

        <H3>Gold FISH</H3>
        <button type="Button" onclick="location.href='https://youtu.be/UAr-s_gSIos?si=ZSOX3189I-dhwmmS'">watch</button>
        <IMG src="gold.jpg" width="400" height="200"><p font="30px">These are one of the most popular types of fish kept in aquariums. They come in a variety of colors and sizes and are relatively easy to care for .
        </p>
        <p><strong>WATER MAINTENENCE:</strong>Use a gravel siphon at least once a week to remove the debris and detritus from your substrate and top off your tank with conditioned fresh water. As with all fish systems, it is highly recommended to purchase a liquid-based water quality test kit to maintain good water chemistry.</p>
           <h3>Tetras</h3>
           <button type="Button" onclick="location.href='https://youtu.be/tpMcC7-q3dA?si=h-kP0o1XcbVY0f4T'">watch</button>
           <img src="tetra.jpg" width="400" height="200"><p font="30px">These small, schooling fish come in a variety of colors and are known for their peaceful nature. They require a well-maintained tank with plenty of hiding places .
            In English
            Tetras generally have compressed (sometimes deep), fusiform bodies and are typically identifiable by their fins. They ordinarily possess a homocercal caudal fin (a twin-lobed, or forked, tail fin whose upper and lower lobes are of equal size) and a tall dorsal fin characterized by a short connection to the fish's body.
        </p>
        <p><strong>WATER MAINTENENCE:</strong>For most tetras, pH should be between 6.8 and 7.8, alkalinity between 3° and 8° dkH (50 ppm to 140 ppm) and temperature between 75° and 80° F. If the aquarium is kept in rooms below 75°, use an Aqueon Aquarium Heater to maintain the correct temperature. Exceptions like the Buenos Aires tetra do better in cooler water.</p>
        <H3>Angel Fish</H3>
        <button type="Button" onclick="location.href='https://youtu.be/RDExIvO3BqE?si=7QyP2lCHjam-nVxl'">watch</button>
        <img src="angel.jpg" width="400" height="200"><p font="30px">These are large, graceful fish that come in a variety of colors. They require a large tank and can be aggressive towards other fish .Angelfishes are native to the freshwaters of tropical South America and may grow to a length of about 15 cm (6 inches). They are commonly silvery with vertical dark markings but may be solid or partially black. They are carnivorous and take care of their eggs and young.</p>
        <p><strong>WATER MAINTENENCE:</strong>Captive raised angelfish accept a wide range of water conditions, although they prefer slightly warmer water. pH should be between 6.8 and 7.8, with hardness between 3° and 8° dKH (54 to 145 ppm). Temperature is best kept between 78° and 84° F.</p>
